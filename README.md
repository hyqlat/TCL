# Temporal-Continual-Learning-with-Prior-Compensation-for-Human-Motion-Prediction

We provide model checkpoints for multiple backbone models on different datasets.

### Datasets

The data can be downloaded from the homepage of each respective model. [PGBIG](https://github.com/705062791/PGBIG), [LTD](https://github.com/705062791/PGBIG) and [STSGCN](https://github.com/FraLuca/STSGCN).

### Test

To test each model, navigate to the respective model folder and run 'run.sh'. You can obtain results on different datasets by running different commands in 'run.sh'.
